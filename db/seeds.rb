    Gregor slowly pushed his way over to the door with the chair.  Once there he let go of it and threw himself onto the door, holding himself upright against it using the adhesive on the tips of his legs.  He rested there a little while to recover from the effort involved and then set himself to the task of turning the key in the lock with his mouth.  He seemed, unfortunately, to have no proper teeth - how was he, then, to grasp the key? - but the lack of teeth was, of course, made up for with a very strong jaw; using the jaw, he really was able to start the key turning, ignoring the fact that he must have been causing some kind of damage as a brown fluid came from his mouth, flowed over the key and dripped onto the floor. "Listen", said the chief clerk in the next room, "he's turning the key."  Gregor was greatly encouraged by this; but they all should have been calling to him, his father and his mother too: "Well done, Gregor", they should have cried, "keep at it, keep hold of the lock!"  And with the idea that they were all excitedly following his efforts, he bit on the key with all his strength, paying no attention to the pain he was causing himself.  As the key turned round he turned around the lock with it, only holding himself upright with his mouth, and hung onto the key or pushed it down again with the whole weight of his body as needed.  The clear sound of the lock as it snapped back was Gregor's sign that he could break his concentration, and as he regained his breath he said to himself: "So, I didn't need the locksmith after all". Then he lay his head on the handle of the door to open it completely.  Because he had to open the door in this way, it was already wide open before he could be seen.  He had first to slowly turn himself around one of the double doors, and he had to do it very carefully if he did not want to fall flat on his back before entering the room.  He was still occupied with this difficult movement, unable to pay attention to anything else, when he heard the chief clerk exclaim a loud "Oh!", which sounded like the soughing of the wind. Now he also saw him - he was the nearest to the door - his hand pressed against his open mouth and slowly retreating as if driven by a steady and invisible force.  Gregor's mother, her hair still dishevelled from bed despite the chief clerk's being there, looked at his father.  Then she unfolded her arms, took two steps forward towards Gregor and sank down onto the floor into her skirts that spread themselves out around her as her head disappeared down onto her breast.  His father looked hostile, and clenched his fists as if wanting to knock Gregor back into his room.  Then he looked uncertainly round the living room, covered his eyes with his hands and wept so that his powerful chest shook.  So Gregor did not go into the room, but leant against the inside of the other door which was still held bolted in place.  In this way only half of his body could be seen, along with his head above it which he leant over to one side as he peered out at the others. Meanwhile the day had become much lighter; part of the endless, grey-black building on the other side of the street - which was a hospital - could be seen quite clearly with the austere and regular line of windows piercing its facade; the rain was still falling, now throwing down large, individual droplets which hit the ground one at a time.  The washing up from breakfast lay on the table; there was so much of it because, for Gregor's father, breakfast was the most important meal of the day and he would stretch it out for several hours as he sat reading a number of different newspapers.  On the wall exactly opposite there was photograph of Gregor when he was a lieutenant in the army, his sword in his hand and a carefree smile on his face as he called forth respect for his uniform and bearing.  The door to the entrance hall was open and as the front door of the flat was also open he could see onto the landing and the stairs where they began their way down below.

  Full proudly Arcite spake again: "Thou shalt prove false rather than I. But thou art false, I tell thee openly, for par amour I loved her ere thou. What wilt thou say? Thou knowest not yet whether she be woman or goddess! Thine is holy affec- tion and mine is love, as toward a creature; wherefore I told thee my hap as to my cousin and sworn brother. I put the case that thou lovedst her first : knowest thou not the old clerk's saw 'Who shall lay a law upon a lover?' Love is a greater law, by my head, than may be laid upon any man on earth, and there- fore human law and decrees are broken every day over all this world for love. A man must needs love, maugre his head; he may not flee love though it should slay him, be she maid or widow or wife. And eke it is not likely that ever in all thy days thou shalt stand in her grace, and no more shall I. For well thou knowest that thou and I be doomed to prison perpetu- ally, no ransom availeth us. We strive like the hounds for the bone; they fought all day, yet they gained naught, for there came a kite above them in their fury and bore away the bone betwixt them both. And therefore at the king's court each man for himself, there is no other rule. Love if thou wilt, for I love and ever shall, and in sooth, dear brother, this is all: here in this prison must we endure, and each of us take his lot."

Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the  wholesome exercise and pure air of the forecastle deck.  For as in this world, head-winds are far more prevalent  than winds from astern (that is, if you never violate  the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the com-  modore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at  second hand from the sailors on the forecastle. He thinks  he breathes it first ; but not so. In much the same  way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many other  things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect it.  But wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt  the sea as a merchant sailor, I should now take it into  my head to go on a whaling voyage ; this the invisible  police-officer of the Fates, who has the constant surveil-  lance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me in  some unaccountable way he can better answer than any  one else. And, doubtless, my going on this whaling  voyage formed part of the grand programme of Provi-  dence that was drawn up a long time ago. It came in  as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more exten-  sive performances. I take it that this part of the bill  must have run something like thi
